- Full prof / Professor		(teminal tenure)


Professor Emeritus - achieved tenure but is retired / not as involved
Adjunct is none of the 3, NOT tenure track, temporarily

Research Professor - often not tenured
Extension Scientist / Advisor - NOT
Visiting Assistant Professor - NOT tenure   in that department, might have tenure somewhere else
Institute Professor - maybe? probably
Courtesy Faculty - "secondary home"
Research Associate - nope

Need 3 classifications
1- Tenured and or tenure-track faculty (Assisatnt, Associate, and Full)
2- Non-tenure track faculty (Lecturers, etc....)
3- Support staff (Admiinistrative Assistant, Lab Supervisors, etc....)

blanks / N/A are automatically classified as (4) before going into the classifier to make things easier
